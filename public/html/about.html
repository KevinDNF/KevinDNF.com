        <p>Hi there, I am Kevin David Navarro Faubla, a second year at
        Portsmouth University.
        <p>I am a really passionate student that loves learning new things...
         but anyone can say that, so instead I'd rather just show you
         some of my <a href="projects.html">projects</a>.
        <p>This is my current avatar, so anywhere you see this image,
        it's me...or someone stole it. I drew this for one of my A-Level
        coursework so I might have to update it at some point.
        <p>I love participating in competitions and events, drawing, playing the piano, League of
        Legends, practicing 2A Yo-Yo and designing things here and there.
        <p>If any of my interests align with you...or you are just bored,
        feel free to contact me at:
        <p>
