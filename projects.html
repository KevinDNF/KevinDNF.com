        <h2>Hack Pompey The Game</h2>

          <p>We participated as a group to the Hack Pompey, which is
          a Hackathlon held every year at Portsmouth University. My team
          consisted of
          <a href="https://www.github.com/mercer01">Sam Mercer</a>,
          <a href="https://www.github.com/hopson97">Mathew Hopson</a>,
          <a href="https://www.github.com/mindo21">Matus Minarovic</a>
          and me.
          <p>We decided to create a game, and what better game for the
          hackathlon than the hackathlon itself.
          <p>The idea was that the player had to prepare Hack Pompey all by
          themself, so they will have to fill the stands with food and
          coffee while at the same time register the participants. If
          the player took too long, then the customer
          satisfaction would drop.
          <p>This was the first stage in the game. We had initially planned
          the game to have 3 stages, but we didn't had time to implement all
          of it.

        <div id="profile_body">
          <p>In this competition our task was to design, program and
          present an application for the Kyocera Multi Functional Printer.
          <p>The printer ran java with a proprietary API and the interface
          used html+css.
          <p>Our idea was to create a translator for the printer. So users
          could scan, import from USB/PC or from the cloud and then that
          document would get parsed translated and then printed back
          keeping the same format as before.

        <div id="profile_body">
          <p>This society first started as a club the 2017, it was ran
          by Dr Farzard, a lecturer at Portsmouth University. The goal of
          the club was for students to involve themself with AI and Machine
          Learning since there was no course about these topics at that
          time.
          <p>We had a couple of sessions but since Farzard was really busy
          teaching we couldn't have as many sessions as we would have
          wished for.
          <p><a href="https://www.github.com/muklek">Muklek</a> and me then decided to take control of
          the club, rebrand it and turn it into a official society so that
          its accessible to all the students from every course.
          <p>This meant we had to redesign the session structure, so we
          decided to hold different types of session; technical,
          non-technical, workshops and debates.

          <p>Opye and me volunteered to present at the Artificial Intelligence Club
          at the Portsmouth University. Our task was to teach the club about
          decision trees, how they are applied in the real world and
          program one.
          <p>I was in charge of the programming, so I decided to make a
          music recommendation system for Spotify. I used sklearn and
          Jupyter Notebook to make it more visually appealing for the 
          presentation.
          <p>The data set was gathered using the Spotify api.
          The liked songs come from my top played songs, and the disliked
          songs from a playlist I made for this project.

          <p>This game was programmed for a competition at Portsmouth
          University between first years.
          <p>The goal was to adapt a half finished game created by the
          lecturer and expand it into something interesting.
          <p>The challenging part was that we couldn't use classes and we
          had to use the graphics.py library we where given.
          <p>I decided to make an android with a jet-pack with the goal of
          getting to the exit while catching as many apples as possible.
          <p>Touching a mine (those weird blue things) would make the
          android explode.

          <p>I programmed this game for my A-Level CS Coursework and
          designed the art for my A-Level Graphics coursework.
          <p>The game was inspired by SmashBros and the art by The World
          Ends with You. Which are some of my favourite games.
          <p>Its programmed in Monkey X and the only reason for that is
          because our teacher at that time thought that using an obscure
          language would mean higher grades as the examiner would struggle
          to understand the code.
